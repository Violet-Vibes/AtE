# AtE
Assistant to the Exile
-----------

This is a C# tool and library for passive reading of structured data from Path of Exile's memory.

All the original data and techniques came from the now defunct ExileApi: https://github.com/queuete/ExileApi

This tool will not modify any memory values, or modify Path of Exile memory in any way.

Features:
- Auto Flask usage
- Auto Skill usage
- Add Icons to the mini map
- Add contextual overlays

Most of the Features are ported from either older ExileApi plugins, or my Assistant plugin for ExileApi.

If you want to write a plugin, see `Plugins/Example.cs`.

If all you want are working offests, see `PoE/Offsets.cs`, where all the offsets and memory structures are documented.
